# Project Description
This project is an ASP.NET Core MVC project that simulates a video-game store. A user can make an account, login and browse different store location inventories. They can add the items and quantities they want to their cart. From their cart they can remove items or checkout. Users can also view their past order history. If a user is in an admin role, they can add, edit, or remove item categories, items, stores, and inventories. They can also view all of the users and their past orders. As well as view all orders from each store. If you need to add another admin account, a current admin user will have to create the new admin account.
